### What is the difference between OOP and POP?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

**Focus on objects:** Data and functions are encapsulated within objects.<br/>
**Data is encapsulated:** Data is protected within objects and can only be accessed through member functions.<br/>
**Reusability:** Code can be reused through inheritance and polymorphism.<br/>

- Procedural Programming (POP) in C++

**Focus on functions:** Code is organized into functions that perform specific tasks.<br/>
**Data is global:** Variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.<br/>
**Top-down approach:** Problem-solving involves breaking down tasks into smaller functions.<br/>
